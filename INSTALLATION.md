# Installation

The simplist way to try SecretFlow is to use [offical docker image](#option-2-from-docker) which ships with SecretFlow binary.

Or you could [install SecretFlow via Python Package Index](#option-1-from-pypi).

For advanced users, you could [install SecretFlow from source](#option-3-from-source).

After installation, don't forget to [have a quick try](#a-quick-try) to check if SecretFlow is good to go.


## Environment
Pythonï¼š3.8

pip: >= 19.3

OS: CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04

CPU/Memory: recommended minimum requirement is 8C16G.

## Option 1: from pypi
For users who want to try SecretFlow, you can install [the current release](https://pypi.org/project/secretflow/).

Note that it requires python version == 3.8, you can create a virtual environment with conda if not satisfied.

```
conda create -n sf python=3.8
conda activate sf
```

After that, please use pip to install SecretFlow.

```bash
pip install -U secretflow
```

## Option 2: from docker
You can also use SecretFlow Docker image to give SecretFlow a quick try.

The latest version can be obtained from [secretflow tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretflow/secretflow-anolis8/tags).

```
export version={SecretFlow version}
```

for example
```bash
export version=0.6.13b1
```

then run the image.
```bash
docker run -it secretflow/secretflow-anolis8:${version}

```

## Option 3: from source

1. Download code and set up Python virtual environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretflow/secretflow.git
cd secretflow

conda create -n secretflow python=3.8
conda activate secretflow
```

2. Install SecretFlow
```sh

python setup.py bdist_wheel

pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Option 4: from WSL

SecretFlow does not support Windows directly now, however, a Windows user can use secretFlow by WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux).

1. Install WSL2 in Windows

- You are supposed to follow the [guide_zh](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/install) or [guide_en](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) in your Windows and make sure that the version of WSL is 2.
- As for the distribution of GNU/Linux, Ubuntu is recommended.

2. Install Anaconda in WSL

Just follow the installation of anaconda in GNU/Linux to install anaconda in your WSL.

3. Install secretflow

- create conda environment

```shell
conda create -n sf python=3.8
```

- activate the environment

```shell
conda activate sf
```

- use pip to install SecretFlow.

```
pip install -U secretflow
```

## GPU support

NVIDIA's CUDA and cuDNN are typically used to accelerate the training and testing of Tensoflow and PyTorch deep learning models. Tensoflow and PyTorch are both deep learning backends for SecretFlow, and if you want to use GPU acceleration in SecretFlow, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure your NVIDIA driver is available

```bash
nvidia-smi
```

2. Follow the [NVIDIA official guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker) to setup NVIDIA Container Toolkit on your distributions.
2. Use a dockerfile file to construct an image

- Download code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/secretflow/secretflow.git
cd secretflow/docker
```

- Construct an image

```bash
docker build -f  sf-gpu.Dockerfile -t secretflow-gpu .
```

3. Run an container

```bash
docker container run -it --gpus all  secretflow-gpu bash
```

- `--gpus all`:This parameters and values are essential

1. After the container is running, you can use the jupyter notebook ./docs/tutorial/GPU_check.ipynb to check the callability of Tensorflow and PyTorch for NVIDIA GPUs inside the container.

## A quick try

Try your first SecretFlow program.

```python
>>> import secretflow as sf
>>> sf.init(['alice', 'bob', 'carol'], address='local')
>>> dev = sf.PYU('alice')
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = dev(np.random.rand)(3, 4)
>>> data
<secretflow.device.device.pyu.PYUObject object at 0x7fdec24a15b0>
```
