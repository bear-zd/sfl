# Installation

The simplist way to try SecretFlow is to use [offical docker image](#option-2-from-docker) which shipps with SecretFlow binary.

Or you could [install SecretFlow via Python Package Index](#option-1-from-pypi).

For advanced users, you could [install SecretFlow from source](#option-3-from-source).

After installation, don't forget to [have a quick try](#a-quick-try) to check if SecretFlow is good to go.


## Environment
Pythonï¼š3.8

pip: >= 19.3

OS: CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04

CPU/Memory: recommended minimum requirement is 8C16G.

## Option 1: from pypi
For users who want to try SecretFlow, you can install [the current release](https://pypi.org/project/secretflow/)
from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/secretflow/). Note that it requires python version == 3.8, you can create a virtual environment with conda if not satisfied.

```
conda create -n sf python=3.8
conda activate sf
```

After that, please use pip to install SecretFlow.

```bash
pip install -U secretflow
```

## Option 2: from docker
You can also use SecretFlow Docker image to give SecretFlow a quick try.

The latest version can be obtained from [secretflow tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/secretflow/secretflow-anolis8/tags).

```
export version={SecretFlow version}
```

for example
```bash
export version=0.7.11b0
```

then run the image.
```bash
docker run -it secretflow/secretflow-anolis8:${version}

```

## Option 3: from source

1. Download code and set up Python virtual environment.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/secretflow/secretflow.git
cd secretflow

conda create -n secretflow python=3.8
conda activate secretflow
```

2. Install SecretFlow
```sh

python setup.py bdist_wheel

pip install dist/*.whl
```

## Option 4: from WSL

SecretFlow does not support Windows directly now, however, a Windows user can use secretFlow by WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux).

1. Install WSL2 in Windows

- You are supposed to follow the [guide_zh](https://learn.microsoft.com/zh-cn/windows/wsl/install) or [guide_en](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) in your Windows and make sure that the version of WSL is 2.
- As for the distribution of GNU/Linux, Ubuntu is recommended.

2. Install Anaconda in WSL

Just follow the installation of anaconda in GNU/Linux to install anaconda in your WSL.

3. Install secretflow

- create conda environment

```shell
conda create -n sf python=3.8
```

- activate the environment

```shell
conda activate sf
```

- use pip to install SecretFlow.

```
pip install -U secretflow
```

## A quick try
Try your first SecretFlow program.

```python
>>> import secretflow as sf
>>> sf.init(['alice', 'bob', 'carol'], num_cpus=8, log_to_driver=True)
>>> dev = sf.PYU('alice')
>>> import numpy as np
>>> data = dev(np.random.rand)(3, 4)
>>> data
<secretflow.device.device.pyu.PYUObject object at 0x7fdec24a15b0>
```
